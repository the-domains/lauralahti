Inspired by iPhone camera accessories, the eMonocle can be stuck to clear glasses or sunglasses like vinyl cling and then easily removed. I first introduced this concept to the public in December 2011 at the NextGens Technologies Conference in Miami. 

This allows wearable technology to be socially acceptable. The public, and especially the person you are talking to, will know when you are engaging with them or with the eMonocle, by watching your eye contact. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1229b786-ea49-4dea-9328-b5db5520baef.png)

This is the same social principle as glancing away when a television, poster, or another person is present in the room when you are engaged in conversation.

To further the social acceptability of VR, the eMonocle intentionally confines the visual augmentation into the parameters of existing posters, billboards, and other pre-existing signage. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a7009dfe-e04e-4321-afe8-9f45dcd7c680.jpg)

For example, a news reporter can introduce himself to NBA star Demarcus Cousins (above) while secretly glancing at Cousin's digital stats off a poster in the background, through his eMonocle.

If there is no signage in the room, the eMonocle will also display content on the palm of your hand or on the Smart Ball (see my other projects for Smart Ball description).

I envision this coming into play first inside vehicles. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/43790e2e-2c75-43ce-8699-6dbcb9b3b28b.jpg)

When reading about the latest car heads up displays-- and also all the texting-while-driving disasters happening nationwide-- I wondered how we could incorporate texts safely into the driving experience. 

I realized that we can use the existing standard 'safe' signage around us, and overlay our own private information on top of these places. 

The advertising world will have to adjust, as they always do, perhaps by displaying virtual ad space when you have no texts or emails to be read.
